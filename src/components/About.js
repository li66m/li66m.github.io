            <p>Hello, I'm a 3rd year student enrolled in Computer Science at Carleton University. I'm in the Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence stream.
                I made this website to enhance my React.js skills and because I'm bored. </p>
            <p>The posts section is supposed a blog-like style format. Hopefully I'll keep that updated. 
                The portfolio section is were I will be posting cool projects and such. About is the section you're currently in. And finally, 
                the contact which will just have my contact info. 
            </p>
        </div>
